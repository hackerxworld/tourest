            <h5 data-aos="fade-out">What is a Website Privacy Policy:</h5>
            <p data-aos="fade-out">
              A Privacy Policy can be described as a statement that outlines the
              website's Policy on gathering and using information about a
              visitor to its site.
            </p>
            <p data-aos="fade-out">
              A Privacy Policy generally spells out the details about sharing
              customers'names, addresses, phone numbers, and Email Ids with
              third parties. Certain web pages even ask visitors to click a
              button to acknowledge that they have read and agreed to the
              Privacy Policy of the site.
            </p>
            <h5 data-aos="fade-out">The need for a Privacy Policy:</h5>
            <p data-aos="fade-out">
              A visitor to the website is somewhat disturbed when suddenly asked
              about the name, postal address, telephone numbers, credit card
              particulars and certain other personal information.
            </p>
            <p data-aos="fade-out">
              It is a natural human tendency not to part with personal
              information unless assured that it will not be shared with third
              parties and the information will not be misused. Thus the need for
              an unambiguously written Privacy Policy is desired.
